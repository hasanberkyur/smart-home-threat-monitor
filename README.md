# Smart Home Network Threat Monitor

## Overview

A lightweight network threat monitoring system for smart home environments. 
The system uses a gateway-based NIDS to generate high-quality security signals,
automates triage and response via n8n, and optionally leverages an LLM for analyst-style summaries.

This project focuses on producing high-signal, low-noise network security events suitable for automated workflows and LLM-assisted triage, rather than raw packet-level alerting.
